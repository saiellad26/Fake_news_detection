# Fake_news_detection
The goal of this project is to explore various machine learning models for detecting fake news based on text analysis.
Using a combination of text preprocessing methods like stemming and vectorization, the project applies classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree to predict whether a 
news article is fake or real. These models can offer insights into how machine learning can be used effectively in this domain and how performance varies across different algorithms.
 Fake news detection is crucial to mitigate the impact of misleading or fabricated information on society. 
 This project explores machine learning models to tackle the challenge of detecting fake news.
